# Pixel_Ruler
On screen ruler to measure pixels.
Small effort in c# using winforms in order to save myself time in my current job instead of just estimating pixels,
and eliminating the need to keep opening labour intensive applications like photoshop when this lightweight desktop app can
be used instead.
